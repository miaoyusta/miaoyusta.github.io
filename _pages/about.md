I am currently a PhD candidate at the  [Institute of Statistics](https://www.statistik.uni-hannover.de/de/institut/team), [Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/) since 2023, under the supervision of Prof. Dr.  Philipp Sibbertsen. My research focuses on time series analysis, functional data analysis and their applications in energy markets. I am giving the lecture Time Series Analysis, Advanced Time Series Analysis and Computationally Intensive Statistics.

Previously, I earned a M.Sc. in Statistics and a  B.Sc. in Mathematics, and my findings have appeared in leading journals such as Information Sciences. Looking forward, I aim to develop real‑time forecasting frameworks—grounded in functional data methods—to address the urgent challenges of sustainable energy management.
