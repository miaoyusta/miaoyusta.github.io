I am a PhD student in Economics [Institute of Statistics](https://www.statistik.uni-hannover.de/de/institut/team), [Leibniz Universität Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/), Germany. My research focuses on functional time series analysis and its applications to energy and electricity market data, with particular interest in seasonal and trend modeling, functional data methods, and statistical learning for complex time-dependent data.

I received my Master’s degree in Applied Statistics and my Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Shandong University of Technology. My previous work concentrated on multi-view clustering algorithms and online learning methods, and has been published in journals such as Applied Energy, Information Sciences, and Neurocomputing. I am also a co-developer of the R package ORKM (available on CRAN), which implements online regularized K-means clustering for multi-view data.

In addition to my research, I am involved in teaching at Leibniz Universität Hannover, contributing to courses in Time Series Analysis, Advanced Time Series Analysis, and Computer-Intensive Statistics.
